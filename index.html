the corona virus is causing
people to shut down for business
making their financial future very uncertain

venmo was built to help people support each other,
especially in times like these.

one person can't solve this problem,
so we're asking, for us to all chip in.

one nation, everybody together.

if ur able to support the people/ buisnesses
with venmo, it will help. thank you for your support.

with laughter, love & gratitude,<br/>
ny, iqram, kortina, jesse & john<br/>
